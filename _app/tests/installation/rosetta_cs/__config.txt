# omnigrok is tested on a base Ubuntu 11.04 with the following small modifications
#   openssh-server installed
# added the following line to the *bottom* of the /etc/sudoers file using visudo to allow it to do sudo commands without needing to supply the password.
#   ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
# (Note, in virtualbox, used bridged networking)

# These variables are used in the various scripts that need them by using the
# load_var function.  They may be overridden by command-line options given to
# the provisionator.
