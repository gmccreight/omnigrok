[Omnigrok](http://github.com/gmccreight/omnigrok) is a polyglot algorithm and data structure learning platform.  It aims to have hundreds of immediately runnable algorithms and data structures in a wide variety of languages, all with extensive unit testing.  It also aims to be readily usable in a classroom setting.

Usage

Omnigrok can be used three different ways.

* Easiest: The website, [omnigrok.com](http://omnigrok.com), provides a try-in-the-browser interface.
* Easy: a downloadable Vagrant box allows you to run Omnigrok in a specially configured Ubuntu 12.04 Server on your local machine.
* Not-so-easy (developers): The source code contains an install script that installs everything onto an Ubuntu 12.04 Server.
