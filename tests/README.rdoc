= Testing

== Introduction
These unit tests are aimed at other developers.

They require runVimTests, a vim plugin available on the vim.org website.

Once runVimTests is installed, in the shell you can:
 cd git-vim
 runVimTests tests

It will run all the .vim files in the tests directory and gather the results
in a test harness, printing a summary.

You can also use the Makefile to run the tests.  To do that, just run:
 make test

Within vim, you'll need to run:
 :!make test

The raw 'make test' ex command fails, but when run as a shell command it works.

== Compatibility
These unit tests were developed on a Linux system.  They require Cygwin to
run in Windows.  It's not for any fundamental reason, just that they use some
shell commands to create the directory under git control.  If someone wanted to
put in the effort, the tests could be made cross platform relatively easily.
