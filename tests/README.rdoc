= Testing

== Introduction
These application tests are aimed at developers who want to introduce their
solutions into RosettaCode.  By testing the application end-to-end, they help
ensure that the installer correctly handles all the dependencies.

The tests require runVimTests 1.16, a vim plugin available on the vim.org website.

Once runVimTests is installed, in a prompt at the project root:
 runVimTests tests

It will run all the .vim files in the tests directory and gather the results in
a test harness, printing a summary.  The aim should be to have all the tests
pass at all times.
